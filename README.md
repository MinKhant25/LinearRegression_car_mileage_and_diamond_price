This project is based on IBM SkillNetwork's guided project. I modified some steps from original project to reduce mean absolute error of prediction.
This project use jupyter notebook. Include library such as pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy. 
Linear Regression model from sklearn library was used to make prediction
